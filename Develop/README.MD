Work Day Scheduler
Work Day Scheduler

Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application for scheduling your work day. This application allows you to plan your day by entering and saving tasks for specific hours. It provides a clean and intuitive user interface that visually distinguishes between past, present, and future tasks based on the current time.

Features
Hourly Scheduling: Plan your work day by entering tasks for each hour from 9 AM to 5 PM.

Dynamic Styling: Time-blocks change color to indicate whether a task is in the past, present, or future relative to the current time.

Save Tasks: Easily save tasks for each hour, and your entries will persist even if you close and reopen the application.

Intuitive Interface: The application provides a straightforward user interface with a clean and modern design.

Getting Started
To get started with Work Day Scheduler, follow these steps:

Open the application in a modern web browser.

You will see time-blocks for each hour from 9 AM to 5 PM, with text areas to enter your tasks.

Enter your tasks in the text areas and click the corresponding "Save" button to save your entries.

The time-blocks change color to visually represent past (gray), present (red), and future (green) tasks.

Your tasks will be saved in your browser's local storage and will persist even if you close and reopen the application.

Technologies Used
HTML and CSS: The application's structure and styling are built using HTML and CSS.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap is used for styling and responsive design.

Font Awesome: Icons from Font Awesome are used for the "Save" buttons.

Day.js: Day.js is used to handle time-related operations and get the current hour.

jQuery: jQuery is used to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) and add functionality to the application.

Code Implementation
The JavaScript code for this application wraps all DOM interactions to ensure that the code is executed only after the browser has finished rendering all the elements. It retrieves, displays, and saves tasks using local storage. The time-blocks' classes are dynamically updated based on the current time to provide a visual cue for past, present, and future tasks.
